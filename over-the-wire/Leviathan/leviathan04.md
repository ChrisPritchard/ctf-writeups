# Leviathan 4

Username: leviathan4

The home directory contains a hidden folder called `.trash`, which contains an executable called `bin`. Running this results in the following text displayed: `01010100 01101001 01110100 01101000 00110100 01100011 01101111 01101011 01100101 01101001 00001010`. Running this through a binary to text converter (assuming each code is the binary representation of an ascii character) successfully produces the password for leviathan5.

Note: I used the site https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html as a quick converter, but its also easily doable in code either using a framework tool or manual char-by-char conversion.
