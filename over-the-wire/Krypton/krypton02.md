# Krypton 2

Password: `ROTTEN`

The readme at /krypton/krypton2/README says:

> ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher.
> 
> Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm.  In this example
of a substitution cipher, we will explore a 'monoalphebetic' cipher.
Monoalphebetic means, literally, "one alphabet" and you will see why.
> 
> This level contains an old form of cipher called a 'Caesar Cipher'.
A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number.  For example:
> 
> plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k ... <br />
> cipher: G H I J K L M N O P Q ...
> 
> In this example, the letter 'a' in plaintext is replaced by a 'G' in the
ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext 'bad' becomes 'HGJ' in ciphertext.

> The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3.  It is in 5 letter
group ciphertext.  It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher.  Without any
further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break.  You do
not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to a program
that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the key.
If you think logically, this is completely easy.

> The `encrypt` binary will look for the keyfile in your current working
directory. Therefore, it might be best to create a working direcory in /tmp
and in there a link to the keyfile. As the `encrypt` binary runs setuid
`krypton3`, you also need to give `krypton3` access to your working directory.

The contents of `krypton3` in the same directory is: `OMQEMDUEQMEK`

Following the instructions above, after echoing 'A' to a file, results in a ciphertext file containing 'M'. So the caesar cipher is rotating by -12, to produce `CAESARISEASY`
