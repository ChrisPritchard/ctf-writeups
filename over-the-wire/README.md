# OverTheWire

> Original readme is below. As an update after merge into my main CTF-Writeups folder, OverTheWire was some of the first hacking I ever did. I only made it up to Narnia before I moved on to Vulnhub and eventually TryHackMe as my main resources

Scripts and solutions to Over The Wire ([overthewire.org](http://overthewire.org)) puzzles. **Note:** Heavy Spoilers. This repo is for my own reference, and shouldn't be used by others as solutions unless you are really stuck (I was for a few, and needed some help).

I was put onto this after seeing it recommended by @LiveOverflow (his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w) is awesome). Was doing it idly until I showed it to my boss who then raced ahead of me. Now *I* need to take it seriously to put him in his place.

The website is [here](http://overthewire.org/wargames/). I am doing / have done the Wargames in the order suggested.

1. Bandit
2. Leviathan
3. Natas
4. Krypton
5. Narnia
6. Behemoth
