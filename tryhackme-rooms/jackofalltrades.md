# Jack of All Trades

Normally I don't like CTF-heavy challenges (where the box feels more like a puzzle than a real machine) but this one was kind of fun.

1. Recon revealed 22 and 80. However, I couldn't browse to 80? It said something like Format exception in firefox, and so I did a double take: the listeners were swapped! A webserver was listening on 22, while a ssh server was listening on 80 :D Firefox wouldn't let me browse to :22 for security reasons, which is fine: I proceeded with curl and wget.

2. Dirb on the webserver 22 revealed a `/assets` sub dir that was listable. It contained three images and a css file. I downloaded the images, then checked out the source of the root page with curl.

    > curl is fine, but when using it to navigate pages, I like to install `html2text` and pipe the html through it. Particularly for listed directories, this makes a nice readable output.

3. Given one of the images was named `stego.jpg`, I guessed this was a stegography challenge. I installed `steghide` and went looking for a passphrase. The source content of the home page revealed a couple of comments:

    ```
        <!--Note to self - If I ever get locked out I can get back in at /recovery.php! -->
        <!--  UmVtZW1iZXIgdG8gd2lzaCBKb2hueSBHcmF2ZXMgd2VsbCB3aXRoIGhpcyBjcnlwdG8gam9iaHVudGluZyEgSGlzIGVuY29kaW5nIHN5c3RlbXMgYXJlIGFtYXppbmchIEFsc28gZ290dGEgcmVtZW1iZXIgeW91ciBwYXNzd29yZDogdT9XdEtTcmFxCg== -->
    ```

4. I ran that text through `base64 -d` and got: `Remember to wish Johny Graves well with his crypto jobhunting! His encoding systems are amazing! Also gotta remember your password: u?WtKSraq`

5. I tried this password on the `stego.jpg` and got a `creds.txt` file containing: 

    ```
    Hehe. Gotcha!

    You're on the right path, but wrong image!
    ```

6. Testing the other two images, `header.jpg` contained `cms.creds` which contained:

    ```
    Here you go Jack. Good thing you thought ahead!

    Username: jackinthebox
    Password: TplFxiSHjY
    ```

7. These didn't work on ssh, but I guessed they were for the aforementioned recovery.php. I went there and found a login page. The html also contained `GQ2TOMRXME3TEN3BGZTDOMRWGUZDANRXG42TMZJWG4ZDANRXG42TOMRSGA3TANRVG4ZDOMJXGI3DCNRXG43DMZJXHE3DMMRQGY3TMMRSGA3DONZVG4ZDEMBWGU3TENZQGYZDMOJXGI3DKNTDGIYDOOJWGI3TINZWGYYTEMBWMU3DKNZSGIYDONJXGY3TCNZRG4ZDMMJSGA3DENRRGIYDMNZXGU3TEMRQG42TMMRXME3TENRTGZSTONBXGIZDCMRQGU3DEMBXHA3DCNRSGZQTEMBXGU3DENTBGIYDOMZWGI3DKNZUG4ZDMNZXGM3DQNZZGIYDMYZWGI3DQMRQGZSTMNJXGIZGGMRQGY3DMMRSGA3TKNZSGY2TOMRSG43DMMRQGZSTEMBXGU3TMNRRGY3TGYJSGA3GMNZWGY3TEZJXHE3GGMTGGMZDINZWHE2GGNBUGMZDINQ=`. Looks like base32 to me.

8. Using [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base32('A-Z2-7%3D',true)From_Charcode('Space',16)ROT13(true,true,13)&input=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) I decoded that as base32 > from charcodes > rot13, to get the following: `Remember that the credentials to the recovery login are hidden on the homepage! I know how forgetful you are, so here's a hint: bit.ly/2TvYQ2S`. A tip to use steg hide on the images, which I had already figured out :) The link is to the wikipedia page for the stegosaurus dinosaur (which was also what the stego.jpg image was of).

9. I logged in with the recovered credentials above and got a page that said `GET me a 'cmd' and I'll run it for you Future-Jack.`

    > To log in, I decided to force firefox to let me access :22 as a webserver. The steps to do this were simple:
    > 1. go to `about:config`
    > 2. search for the key `network.security.ports.banned.override`
    > 3. If it had existed, I would add `,22` on the end of its value
    > 4. It didn't so I added it and set its value to `22`

10. Appending `?cmd=ls` to the url returned `ls` results, so this page is basically a webshell. `whoami` returned `www-data`

11. Surprise surprise, `whereis nc` returned `nc.traditional` which meant I could use `nc -e`. With this I quickly got a reverse shell on the system.

12. In the root of `/home` there was a `/jack` folder I couldn't access, and a file called `jacks_password_list` containing the below:

    ```
    *hclqAzj+2GC+=0K
    eN<A@n^zI?FE$I5,
    X<(@zo2XrEN)#MGC
    ,,aE1K,nW3Os,afb

    z@e1PmlmQ%k5sDz@
    ow5APF>6r,y4krSo
    ```

13. The above looks encoded, but I couldn't guess how. I thought I might as well try them as presented: as possible passwords for the user `jack`. I thought about writing a script to do it, but interacting with password prompts is difficult (could have done it with `expect` probably) and there were not so many. So I just manually tried `su jack` with each, going down the list. Fortunately, the fifth entry `ITMJpGGIqg1jn?>@` worked and I became `jack`.

    > At this point I quickly disconnected and reconnected over `ssh -p 80 jack@10.10.206.89`, to get a friendlier shell.

14. In jacks root directory was `user.jpg`. I used scp to get this back to my attacker machine, then spinned up a server to serve it so I could view from my host machine with firefox. The image was a recipe for penguin soup, with one of the ingredients being the user flag: `securi-tay2020_{p3ngu1n-hunt3r-3xtr40rd1n41r3`

15. jack had no sudo privliges. A `find / -user root -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null` revealed `/usr/bin/strings` as the odd executable out.

16. With a wild guess, victory: `/usr/bin/strings /root/root.txt` revealed:

    ```
    ToDo:
    1.Get new penguin skin rug -- surely they won't miss one or two of those blasted creatures?
    2.Make T-Rex model!
    3.Meet up with Johny for a pint or two
    4.Move the body from the garage, maybe my old buddy Bill from the force can help me hide her?
    5.Remember to finish that contract for Lisa.
    6.Delete this: securi-tay2020_{6f125d32f38fb8ff9e720d2dbce2210a}
