# PWN101

https://tryhackme.com/room/pwn101

A great room for learning and practicing 'beginner-level' binex or pwn challenges, on 64bit linux.

There are 10 binaries which you can download, allowing you to retrieve a flag from 10 remote ports. Because these are each self contained and not insignificant, I have solved them as 10 separate python programs, using pwntools. Hopefully each is self explanatory - I've tried to add comments explaining things.

- [pwn101.py](./pwn101.py)
- [pwn102.py](./pwn102.py)
- [pwn103.py](./pwn103.py)
- [pwn104.py](./pwn104.py)
- [pwn105.py](./pwn105.py)
- [pwn106.md](./pwn106.md) - this one can be done with pure bash
- [pwn107.py](./pwn107.py)
- [pwn108.py](./pwn108.py)
- [pwn109.py](./pwn109.py)
- [pwn110.py](./pwn110.py)

A great room, though it took me almost a week to get through haha.
