"The basics of Penetration Testing, Enumeration, Privilege Escalation and WebApp testing"

A fun room. Had some difficulty enumerating, but ultimately solved it without any help. Took longer than I would have liked though - but it was a fairly clever room.

1. Recon revealed 21, 22, 8081 and 31331. The last two were two websites: 8081 was a node.js 'rest' api, and 31331 a static html website running on apache.

2. `robots.txt` for the website revealed a `utech_sitemap.txt` file, which contained a path I didn't find through dirb: `partners.html`. This was a login page that, through javascript, invoked two urls on the api:

    ```javascript
        (function() {
        console.warn('Debugging ::');

        function getAPIURL() {
        return `${window.location.hostname}:8081`
        }
        
        function checkAPIStatus() {
        const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
        try {
            const url = `http://${getAPIURL()}/ping?ip=${window.location.hostname}`
            req.open('GET', url, true);
            req.onload = function (e) {
            if (req.readyState === 4) {
                if (req.status === 200) {
                console.log('The api seems to be running')
                } else {
                console.error(req.statusText);
                }
            }
            };
            req.onerror = function (e) {
            console.error(xhr.statusText);
            };
            req.send(null);
        }
        catch (e) {
            console.error(e)
            console.log('API Error');
        }
        }
        checkAPIStatus()
        const interval = setInterval(checkAPIStatus, 10000);
        const form = document.querySelector('form')
        form.action = `http://${getAPIURL()}/auth`;
        
    })();
    ```

3. Going to that `/ping?ip=` on the api revealed output that looked like the output of a native bash ping command. So...command injection.

4. I could confirm it partially worked via ```/ping?ip=`ls` ``` which gave a single file: `utech.db.sqlite`. But how to get that out?

5. I tried numerous things. Common injection like `&` or `|` did nothing - in fact, I suspect they were bing trimmed since `120.0.0.1|test` was printed as an error like `no domain named 127.0.0.1test`. `nc` was on the machine, but not the mc that uses `-e`. However, using nc, I was able to tickle my kali reverse proxy, so I guessed a proper reverse shell might be possible.

6. Ultimately I used three steps: first I encoded a reverse shell script using base64, then I used the injection to emit it: `echo encoded > shell.t`. Next I used `base64 -d shell.t > shell.o`, and finally I invoked the reverse shell via `bash shell.o`. No pipes required.

7. Once on the box I was able to inspect the `utech.db.sqlite` file from before (a simple `cat` worked, given its tiny) revealed two users with password hashes in md5. `r00t` had a home folder, so I took his/her hash and cracked it with hashcat, then dropped my reverse shell and ssh'd in normally.

    > I also used the credentials from one of the users in the file to login in via the earlier found login pages at this point. This was the message I was greeted with:
    >
    > Restricted area
    >
    > Hey r00t, can you please have a look at the server's configuration?
    > The intern did it and I don't really trust him.
    > Thanks!
    >
    > lp1

8. Enumeration revealed nothing obvious. However docker was installed. Given the page had said (and the auth / login page had said the same when I logged in with one of the cracked hashes) that `the intern had misconfigured something`, I guessed that something was probably running as root when it shouldn't have been. `id -Gn` revealed `r00t` was part of the docker group.

9. I scp'd an alpine docker image onto the machine, then ran it with `docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh` and BOOM! root shell :)

The final question in the room was the first nine characters of the root user's ssh private key, which was found in `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`. Easy (took me hours, one of which was spent looking everywhere BUT docker)!
