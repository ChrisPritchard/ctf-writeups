## Task 1

- the pcap file is a series of usb messages, with the data being in the 'usb.capdata' field ('leftover capture data' in the wireshark ui)
- this can be extracted with tshark, like so: `tshark -r pcap2.pcapng -Y 'usb.src == "1.7.1"' -Tfields -e usb.capdata > raw`
- the result will be hex encoded, so convert to raw binary with cyberchef or using xxd: `xxd -r -p raw raw2.bin`
- you can then use binwalk to see this is a zip file, and extract its contents (another pcap) with `binwalk -e raw2.bin`
- in the second pcap, whats immediately obvious is a lot of icmp packets. filtering to just those without the standard data length, a conversation becomes visible
- the conversation mentions sending data using 'cryptcat', using that 'Angela Bennett uses it to log into the Bethesda Naval Hospital'. this is a reference to the film The Net from 1995, where the pass `BER5348833` was used.
- the data sent was sent to the metasploit port 4444, and can be seen and extracted with `tshark -r pcap_chal.pcap -Y 'tcp.dstport == 4444' -Tfields -e data.data > raw3` and decoded from hex with `xxd -r -p raw3 raw4.bin`
- to decrpt with the password, simple way is to use cryptcat and netcat: cryptcat to listen with `cryptcat -vv -k BER5348833 -l -p 1337 > raw5.bin` and netcat to send with `nc -vv -w 1 localhost 1337 <raw4.bin`
- using `file` on raw5.bin will reveal it as a ELF binary.
- decompiling this ghidra (it would not run properly on any machine i had access to) will reveal that past some IRC messages, it takes a message encoded in the binary and applies ROT13 then reverses it, before wrapping with CCT{}. the string can be taken from ghidra or recovered using strings, then rotted with cyberchef and reversed - the final flag is leetcode with a harry potter theme

## Task 2

- the download is a windows executable, and using strings on it reveals it to be a .NET binary pretty quickly (System. stuff, mscorlib etc)
- running it showed four sliders, and if each is aligned to the right number a button will reveal the flag.
- to examine the binary, I used [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) a free decompiler, which showed the four numbers must sum to 711 and multiply (their product) to 711000000.
- instead of doing the math, the solution was to extract the byte array that is decoded using the answer. This is a 32 byte array, where based on the value of one of the sliders, each character is XOR'd with (177 - the_value). The final result must be a valid 32-character hex string

To solve this, I used https://replit.com/languages/csharp to write some C# code and run it, the code shown below:

```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        byte[] byteA = new byte[32]
          {
            (byte) 20,
            (byte) 22,
            // ... copied from decompilation
          };

    for (var A_1 = 0; A_1 <= 711; A_1++) {
        var A_3 = new byte[byteA.Length];
        for(var index = 0; index < byteA.Length; index++) 
        {
          var c = (byte) ((uint) byteA[index] ^ (uint) (byte) (177 ^ A_1));
          A_3[index] = c;
        }
        var s = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetString(A_3);
        if (s.Length != 32) continue;
        var valid = true;
        for (var i = 0; i < 32; i++) 
          if (!((s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z') || (s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9'))) {
              valid = false;
          }
        if (valid) Console.WriteLine(A_1+": [["+s+"]]");
      }
  }
}
```

This result in two possible candidates (well, six, but two unique). The second one I tried was successful.
