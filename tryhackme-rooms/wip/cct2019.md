## Task 1

- the pcap file is a series of usb messages, with the data being in the 'usb.capdata' field ('leftover capture data' in the wireshark ui)
- this can be extracted with tshark, like so: `tshark -r pcap2.pcapng -Y 'usb.src == "1.7.1"' -Tfields -e usb.capdata > raw`
- the result will be hex encoded, so convert to raw binary with cyberchef or using xxd: `xxd -r -p raw raw2.bin`
- you can then use binwalk to see this is a zip file, and extract its contents (another pcap) with `binwalk -e raw2.bin`
- in the second pcap, whats immediately obvious is a lot of icmp packets. filtering to just those without the standard data length, a conversation becomes visible
- the conversation mentions sending data using 'cryptcat', using that 'Angela Bennett uses it to log into the Bethesda Naval Hospital'. this is a reference to the film The Net from 1995, where the pass `BER5348833` was used.
- the data sent was sent to the metasploit port 4444, and can be seen and extracted with `tshark -r pcap_chal.pcap -Y 'tcp.dstport == 4444' -Tfields -e data.data > raw3` and decoded from hex with `xxd -r -p raw3 raw4.bin`
- to decrpt with the password, simple way is to use cryptcat and netcat: cryptcat to listen with `cryptcat -vv -k BER5348833 -l -p 1337 > raw5.bin` and netcat to send with `nc -vv -w 1 localhost 1337 <raw4.bin`
- using `file` on raw5.bin will reveal it as a ELF binary.
- decompiling this ghidra (it would not run properly on any machine i had access to) will reveal that past some IRC messages, it takes a message encoded in the binary and applies ROT13 then reverses it, before wrapping with CCT{}. the string can be taken from ghidra or recovered using strings, then rotted with cyberchef and reversed - the final flag is leetcode with a harry potter theme
